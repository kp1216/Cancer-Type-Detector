#  Skin Cancer Classification — HAM10000 (High Imbalance Dataset)

This project tackles **skin cancer detection** using the HAM10000 dataset—a highly imbalanced collection of dermatoscopic images. It leverages Kaggle Notebooks for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

##  Dataset

- **Dataset**: [Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 (10,000 Images, Augmented)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshps/skin-cancer-mnist10000-ham-augmented-dataset)  
  A well-known dataset containing 10,000 dermatoscopic images across multiple skin lesion categories—benign and malignant. It offers data augmentation to partially mitigate class imbalance.

##  Project Overview

Aimed at performing **skin lesion classification**, this project addresses:
- **Class imbalance**, where certain lesion types (e.g., malignant) are underrepresented.
- **Model training and evaluation** using widely adopted deep learning methodologies.

All computations and experiments are conducted using **Kaggle Notebooks**, enabling reproducible and shareable workflows.

##  Features

- **Data Loading & Exploration**
  - Overview of lesion distribution across classes.
  - Visualization of imbalance and augmented samples.

- **Preprocessing & Augmentation**
  - Train/validation/test split with stratification.
  - Image resizing, normalization.
  - Optional data augmentation: rotations, flips, brightness/contrast adjustments.

- **Handling Imbalance**
  - Class weights or resampling to give more focus to underrepresented classes.
  - Metrics beyond accuracy—Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix.

- **Model Architectures**
  - Baseline models: simple CNNs.
  - Transfer learning using pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet).

- **Training Pipeline**
  - Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, epochs).
  - Early stopping, checkpointing, and learning rate schedulers for stable training.

- **Evaluation**
  - Quantitative metrics per class.
  - ROC curves to assess classifier effectiveness across imbalance.
  - Confusion matrix for visual inspection of misclassifications.

##  Why It Matters: Imbalanced Skin Lesion Data

- **High clinical stakes**: Early detection of melanoma and other skin cancers can save lives.
- **Bias in training**: Models trained on imbalanced datasets often face high false-negative rates for rare but critical classes.
- By emphasizing **balanced evaluation** and **class-sensitive training**, this project strives for more reliable and clinically useful models.

##  Future Work & Extensions

- Experiment with **class-balanced loss functions** (e.g., focal loss).
- Use **GAN-based augmentation** to synthetically enhance minority classes.
- Implement **model ensembling** to boost performance.
- Deploy the model as a web app or integrate into clinical workflows.
